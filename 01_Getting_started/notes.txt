Chapter 1: CSS: 
---------------
Cascading Style Sheets is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, paper or on other media.

HTML gives structure to the document and CSS takes care of the appearance/presentation aspect

Anatomy of CSS ruleset:
-----------------------
p -> selector
property -> color
property value -> orangered

property and property value together is defined as a declaration and the whole structure is called a ruleset/rule

The declaration will be ignored if the property name is not specified correct, it doesnt throw any error
